The News Scraper is an application that allows a user to scrape articles from Snopes.com (a popular political fact checker), save articles, and write notes on their saved articles. 

This application utilizes Express.js, Node.js, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and MongoDB/Mongoose. In order for a user to engage with this application, he/she simply needs to click on this link **Link**

From there, the user has a couple of options. The user can click on *Scrape Articles* at the top of the screen to scrape new articles from Snopes. If this is the first time the user is visiting the site, he or she should click that button first. Once the site has populated with articles, the user can look through the articles and if the user finds one that he/she wants to look at later, he/she can click on *Save Article*. To view saved articles, the user simply needs to click on *Saved Articles* at the top of the page.

Once the user has saved an article, he/she can write notes that will be attached to that article. All the user needs to do to create a note is enter a title and note in the fields provided and click *Save*. If the user no longer needs or wants the note, he/she can click *Delete Note* to get rid of it. Finally, if the user no longer wants to save an article, all he/she needs to do is click *Delete Article* and the article will be removed from their saved articles page.

I faced a number of challenges with this assignment. I had a lot of trouble with the routes and the handlebars. In order to handle some of these issues, I worked with my colleagues and reached to to class resources for assistance. By leveraging my resources and bouncing ideas off of team members, I was able to deliver a product on time.
